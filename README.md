# CS Intern Journey

Tracking my nightly Python learning for remote CS internships.

## Projects
- **day_1.py**: Basic calculator with try/except error handling.
- **todo_list.py**: Interactive to-do app with menu, add/delete/view, and file persistence.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/peter-pheak/cs-intern-journey.git`
2. Run `python todo_list.py` for the main app.

## Next Goals
Week 2: Dive into functions and data structures.
